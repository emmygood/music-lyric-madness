## Code Validation

### HTML Validaton

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Responsivness 

I have used the Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool to make sure the site is accessible for all. All pages passed with no errors. Here are the results below.

- [Wave Link Home](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://emmygood.github.io/music-quiz-madness/index.html)

- [Wave Link End](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://emmygood.github.io/music-quiz-madness/end.html)

## Compatability 

I have tested the site on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) as well as different screen sizes (laptop, tablet and smartphone) to test the responsivness. As well as this, I tested the site with development tools, whilst in the building stages, to ensure the responsivness of the site across different devices.

I tested the site on different devices to set the compatability. I tested it on my smartphone (samsung) and was very pleased with how everything responded. As well as testing it on my laptop to see how it responded to a larger screen size.

| Device | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile (DevTools) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/samsung1.png) | Works as expected |
